<strong>If you're 8 to 16 years old, there's a 19% chance you've had <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/51451737>bad dreams</a>  
about the climate change.</strong> In case you're older, you might have already thought about your carbon footprint. Better yet, you would
like to start minimizing it. If that is your case, you should start by having fewer children. At least that's what a 2017 study claims,
calculating the potential CO₂ emissions reduction of such action to 58.6 tonnes annually. Any other option would have by far less impact,
but it's still worth considering living car-free (2.4 tCO₂e), avoiding plane travel (1.6 tCO₂e per single transatlantic flight!) or eating
plant-based diet only (0.8 tCO₂e).

In 1798, Thomas Malthus famously claimed, that "The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to 
produce subsistence for man". He believed that abundance will always lead to population growth rather than high standard of living. 
In many ways, his overly pessimistic predictions were proved wrong by technology and all the childless households of today.

The main message of his work repeatedly became revived in voices of those concerned by the future of humankind. In the late 1960s and 1970s, 
Paul Ehrlich expected the earth’s resources to dry out soon, precipitating a “great die-off” that would commence in the 1980s.
More than 200 years after Malthus, congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez 
<a href=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/431440-ocasio-cortez-in-face-of-climate-change-its-legitimate-to-ask-if-ok/>tries</a> 
 to convince her Instragram followers, that it is a "legitimate question" to doubt whether it's ok for parents to continue to 
have children in this age.

And she might be right. A 2017 study from Lund University found that the single most efficient action to decrease 
our carbon footprint is having smaller families.
IF YOU’RE IN POSSESSION of a uterus, at some point in your life you’ve likely gotten the message that having children isn’t a choice—it’s your duty. 
But as more colleges turned coed, and women suffragists gained support for their mission to get the vote, extra efforts became necessary to direct American women toward the role of uncomplaining motherhood. In 1873, as female educators pressured Harvard University to admit women, one of the university’s professors, physician Edward H. Clarke, published Sex in Education; or, a Fair Chance for Girls, which promoted separate education for the sexes, and profiled women with different levels of schooling who had succumbed to “hysteria.” He claimed that a woman who pursued intellectual stimulus “made her brain and muscles work actively, and diverted blood and force to them,” instead of using her powers “for evolution in [the reproductive] region.” The book’s first edition sold out in a week, then went through 16 more printings.
